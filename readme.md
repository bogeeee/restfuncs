# Restfuncs - HTTP API done proper

<details>
  <summary>What is Restfuncs: Coming from tRPC</summary>

Restfuncs is also an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) library. It also has a client and sever part and also gives the user end2end type safety. 

The key differences are:
- Restfuncs takes [tRPCs claim: "It's just functions"](https://trpc.io/docs/concepts#its-just-functions) for real also for the server side üòé, resulting in a much simpler usage and way less boilerplate. 
- Restfuncs uses (native) typescript for validation, instead of ZOD or other type generators. 
- It has websocket support as first class citizen, enabled by default.
Therefore push events can be achieved just via plain callback functions üëç which you can pass anywhere in the arguments.  
- Cookie sessions / JWT, CSRF protections and CORS are tightly integrated into Restfuncs instead of beeing 3rd party plugins or having to be coded manually.
_This was especially necessary for supporting / syncing  with websockets._
- Concepts are simplified, aiming for less total boilerplate and a more shallow learning curve.
- Also see the additional features in the [list](#intro--features).

Here's a mapping of the tRPC's conceptual items to Restfuncs:
- `Procedure`/`Query`/`Mutation` -> No distinctions between them in restfuncs. It's all just @remote methods. Following GET/POST semantics is done by a client (if needed) and Restfuncs [serves just both styles](#rest-interface) instead of needing configuration.
- `Router` -> `ServerSession`
- `Context` -> `ServerSession` - _you can also store fields there._
- Middlewares ->  You just overwrite the ServerSession#doCall method for this (use ctrl+space / intellisense in your IDE). Needs no further explanation or docs, if you know some basic OOP concepts.
- `Subscriptions` -> You can simply use callback functions anywhere in your @remote methods. _When called, the events automatically get send to the client via websocket push events. No need to set up that channel or synchronize that context manually üëç_.
- Inferring Types -> Not needed. Can just be achieved by Typescript.

  <summary>What is Restfuncs: Coming from Nest or other "big frameworks"</summary>

  Restfuncs is not a framework for organizing your code (and does not want to be such). It is just a small layer above express, to improve communication needs in a one-tool-for-one-purpose manner.
Similiar to those frameworks, it makes coding API endpoints easier and offers you a rich set of features around those (but, as said, just what tightly belongs to http communication. Nothing else). 

Also, Restfuncs it is made for RPC (Remote Procedure Calls): That means, on the client, you don't code a fetch request by hand, but 
just call a remote method, as if it was a normal javascript method (but across the wire). It's an old concept in the IT that was a bit forgotten but regains traction again in the JS world, cause it makes especially sense in a scenario with typescript, both, on the client and the server side.
Therefore, all your calls can be checked for type safety at compile time (end2end type safety). 
A similar popular library that offers such a concept is [tRPC](https://trpc.io/). Think of Restfuncs as a more modern alternative of that.

A Nest' "Controller" (=Service) corresponds to a "ServerSession" class in Restfuncs. That's the only organization unit, it has. Wiring them to the express routes is done manually.
Now you put a few methods (=endpoints) and fields (=session cookie fields) into such a ServerSession class and that's already all the concept ;) There's really nothing more conceptually. Just a lot of configuration options around that.

  <summary>What is Restfuncs: Coming from Express or new to Javascript</summary>

Coding Express handlers (let's call them "endpoints" now) is fun, but soon you will notice, that this is pretty low level and you do all that repetitive
tasks over and over again, like:
- Converting from request/body parameters into local variables 
- Checking these variables against evil input
- Doing error handling and reporting

The same thing on the client where, each time, you code a fetch request by hand and do conversion, status checking/error handling,...

Now, instead of a request handler, in Restfuncs you code your endpoint as a plain javascript function (with typescript types).
And it also offers a client, where you can just virtually call that same function from the client (but it goes over the wire via http or websockets). 

This It's an old concept in the IT that's called RPC (Remote Procedure Call) and it was a bit forgotten but regains traction again in the JS world, cause it makes especially sense in a scenario with typescript, both, on the client and the server side.
Therefore, all your calls can be checked for type safety at compile time (end2end type safety). A similar popular library that offers such a concept is [tRPC](https://trpc.io/). Think of Restfuncs as a more modern alternative of that.

But besides RPC, Restfuncs deals with much more aspects around http-communication, that play together and make just sense to be tightly integrated here into this communication library. But see the features for yourself. 
</details>

## Intro + features

With restfuncs, you write your http API endpoints just as **plain typescript func**tion**s**. Or better say: methods.  
Per-endpoint boilerplate is no more than, i.e.:
````typescript
@remote greet(name: string) {
    return `Hello ${name}` 
}
````
See, it uses natural parameters and natural `return` (and `throw`) flow, instead of you having to deal with `req` and `res` on a lower level. And Restfuncs will take care about a lot more of your daily, low-level communication aspects.  
That is (features):
- üõ°Ô∏è **Automatic arguments validation** against **native typescript types**  
  Like here, you used typescript to say "name must be a `string`". Restfuncs makes sure that no other evil values will be received. String is a simple example but, yes !, you can use the full Typescript syntax, like: refer to your types, unions, interfaces, generics, utility types, conditional types,... everything! No need to learn/use ZOD, Typebox, etc. just for that.
  _Now you may ask how this works, because usually all types are erased at runtime. Answer: Your files go through a set of transformer plugins during compilation which add that information and emit fast precompiled validator code. 
  This is backed by the great [Typia](https://typia.io) and [typescript-rtti](https://typescript-rtti.org) libraries._ [See, how to set up the build for that](#setting-up-the-build-here-it-gets-a-bit-nasty-).
  - üè∑ Ô∏è**Supports [Typia's special type tags](https://typia.io/docs/validators/tags/#type-tags)** like `string & tags.MaxLength<255>`  
    _In cases where the full power of Typescript is still not enough for you ;)_
- üîå Can i cURL it? **Zero conf [REST interface](#rest-interface)**    
   Yes, you can cURL it in all ways you can imagine! And it does not even need any `@Get`, `@Post`, `@route`, `@param`, ... decorations. Say goodbye to them and say hello to zero-conf.
- üçæ **RPC client** üòéüòéüòé  
  Just **call your remote methods** from the client/browser **as if they were local**, like i.e. `await myRemoteSession.greet("Axel")`, while enjoying full end2end type safety.
  - üöÄ Uses **engine.io (web-) sockets**
    
    The client automatically tries to upgrade to  (web-) sockets for faster round trips, better call batching, better general performance and push event (callback) features. Restfuncs makes the behaviour fully transparent and interoperable with classic http: Changes to session fields (**the session cookie**) are automatically and securely **synchronized** to/from other classic http calls, non-restfuncs-clients and clients in other browser tabs. _Still you can switch off sockets and make it do plain HTTP calls._  
- **üîê Security first approach**  
  All protection is in place by default. Exceptions, where you need to take action, are hinted explicitly in the docs, or by friendly error messages on unclear configuration. [Friendly hint here, for, when using client certificates or doing manual http fetches in the browser](#csrf-protection).  
  Restfuncs is designed to handle setups with different security settings per ServerSession class _while they (always) share one cookie-session_. I.e, think of serving a subset of your APIs (ServerSessions) to ALL origins for third party browser apps or for SSO. _[How it works internally](server/Security%20concept.md)_
  - üõ°Ô∏è **[CSRF protection](#csrf-protection) with zero-conf**  
    Especially no csrf tokens need to be passed by you.  _This is said so easy, but there's much effort and research behind the scenes for an in-depth protection of all possible http call situations and also to secure the websocket connection._
  - **üîìCORS**  
    of course also ;), _plays together with the above_. Just set the `ServerSessionOptions#allowedOrigins` option and that's it.
- **‚õ≤ Serve / stream resources**  
  You can also use your remote methods to [serve/stream resources like html pages / images / pdfs / ...](#html--images--binary-as-a-result) just by returning a `Readable`/`Buffer`/`string`
- [**Push events via callback functions**](#server-events-via-callback-functions)   
  It's as simple as sending a callback function in between your usual parameters and you can react to server side events. Great for progress bars, chat rooms, games, realtime data, event subscriptions of any kind...
- COMING SOON  
  _The following coming-soon features are already concepted into the API and already appear in the docs. I'm trying my best, to keep new features non-breaking to make the current 3.x version stay the head._
- COMING SOON: Simple **file uploads**  
  You can [use the Restfuncs client](#ltboilerplate-cheat-sheet---all-you-need-to-knowgt) or [multipart/mime forms (classic)](#rest-interface).
- COMING SOON: **Scalable to a multi node environment**  
  Uses stateless, encrypted tokens (JWT like) for cookie sessions with whitelist validation (be default, for keeping security and low memory footprint / best of both worlds). See `ServerOptions#secret` and `ServerOptions#sessionValidityTracking`
- COMING SOON: **Basic auth** handler  
  Http-session based auth is also covered by the [example](https://github.com/bogeeee/restfuncs/tree/2.x/examples/express-and-vite-with-authentication)
- FUTURE: **API browser**  
  Zero conf and automatically hosted. Just give your partners an URL and they've got all the information and examples they need to call your methods from other programming languages...
  - FUTURE:  ... + can also download the **OpenAPI spec** from there.

Smaller features:
- **Validation everywhere** (by default): Restfuncs validates not only remote method's arguments, but also the result and also args + result of **callbacks** = just everything ;).
- **Argment and result trimming**: By default, restfuncs automatically removes **extra** properties, that would otherwise cause a validation error. Also this allows you to do some [nice Typescript tricks to trim the result into the desired form](#using-typescript-to-automatically-trim-the-output-into-the-desired-form).
- Proper **error handling** and logging.
- **Lazy cookies** throughout: The best session-cookie is one, that is never sent. That is only, if a field of your ServerSession is set to non-initial value, or if (in-depth) csrf protection ultimately requires it. Lessens parsing and validation costs i.e. for public users of your site that never log in. 
- **[A collection of example projects](#example-projects)**. Grab them, if you're looking for a quick starter for your single page application. [![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/bogeeee/restfuncs/tree/3.x/examples/express-and-vite?title=Restfuncs%20hello%20world%20example&file=client%2Findex.ts,GreeterSession.ts) 
- **Enhancement friendly** by exposing a clear OOP API. You are allowed and encouraged to subclass and override methods. Includes .ts source code, source maps and declaration maps in the published NPM package, so you can ctrl+click or debug-step yourself right into the source code and have some fun with it - i hope this inspires other lib authors ;). [Get some insights here](DEVELOPMENT.md).
- **Bloat free**: Restfuncs does not want to sell you any concept for mvc / rendering templates / layered architecture / di / etc. It's only purpose is client<>server communication.

Negative features (downside):
  - Needs a **customized [build setup](#setting-up-the-build-here-it-gets-a-bit-nasty-) with typescript compiling** and needs to run with good-old **Node.js for production**. _For **development**, you're still free to run it how you like (with tsx, bun, ...) üòä._

# Getting started

<details>
  <summary>‚ö†‚ö†‚ö† Security must-read </summary>

- When using **client certificates**, you must also read the [CSRF protection chapter](#csrf-protection). 
- When making **raw calls** via the [REST interface](#rest-interface), see security note there.

_Apart from that, **all security**, which this communication layer (=this Resfuncs library) is responsible for, **is already enabled by default üëç**. I.e., CRSF protection, CORS, param validation, concealing error stacks,... There will be explicit hints if you need to take further action._
</details>

Here's how to set up a server that serves a remote method, named `myRemoteMethod`, and a client that makes a call to that method:
  
**MyServerSession.ts**

````typescript
import {ServerSession, ServerSessionOptions, remote, UploadFile, ClientCallback, ClientCallbackSet, ClientCallbackSetPerItem, free, withTrim} from "restfuncs-server";
import { tags } from "typia";

export class MyServerSession extends ServerSession {

  static options: ServerSessionOptions = {/* ServerSessionOptions */}

  /**
   * This JSDoc also gets outputted in the public API browser and OpenAPI spec. Write only nice things here ;)
   * @param myUserName Some string param.
   * @param someOptionalComplexParam Your parameters can be of any complex typescript type. They are automatically security-validated at runtime to fit into that schema.
   * Also you can use [Typia's special type tags](https://typia.io/docs/validators/tags/#type-tags) like `string & MaxLength<255>`
   */
  @remote({/* RemoteMethodOptions */})
  myRemoteMethod(myUserName: string, someOptionalComplexParam?: { id?: number, city: string & tags.MaxLength<255> }) {
    return `Hello ${myUserName}`
  }
}
````
<br/>

**server.ts**
````typescript
import {restfuncsExpress} from "restfuncs-server";
import {MyServerSession} from "./MyServerSession.js"; // For node, you must use use ".js" instead of ".ts" in your imports (yes, strange) !

const app = restfuncsExpress({/* ServerOptions */}) // Drop in replacement for express (enhances the original). It installs a jwt session cookie middleware and the websockets listener. Recommended.
app.use("/myAPI", MyServerSession.createExpressHandler())

// Optional: app.use(helmet(), express.static('dist/web')) // Serve pre-built web pages / i.e. by a bundler like vite, parcel or turbopack. See examples. It's recommended to use the helmet() middleware for additional protection.
// Optional: app.use(...) //<-- Serve *other / 3rd party* express routes here. SECURITY: These are not covered by restfuncs CSRF protection. Don't do write/state-changing operations in here ! Instead do them by MyServerSession.

app.listen(3000); // Listen on Port 3000
````
<br>

**client.ts**  
_Use a bundler like vite, parcel or turbopack to deliver this file to the browser_
````typescript
import {RestfuncsClient} from "restfuncs-client";
import type {MyServerSession} from "../path/to/server/code/or/its/packagename/MyServerSession.js" // Import the type for **end2end type safety**. Note: Despite some rumors, you don't need a monorepo for this cross-referencing. Just packages next to each other. Or client + server files can live even in the same package. See the examples which show both options.

const myRemoteSession = new RestfuncsClient<MyServerSession>("/myAPI", {/* RestfuncsClientOptions */}).proxy;
console.log( await myRemoteSession.myRemoteMethod("Hans") ); // Call your remote method over the wire üòéüòéüòé
````

### Setting up the build (here, it gets a bit nasty üòà)

**tsconfig.json**
````json
"compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "sourceMap": true, //optional, recommended
    "plugins": [
        { "transform": "restfuncs-transformer",  "transformProgram": true},
        { "transform": "typia/lib/transform" },
        { "transform": "typescript-rtti/dist/transformer" } ],
},
"exclude": ["dist", "client", "web"], // Make sure, to not accidentially transform your client files.
````
**package.json**
````json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development <use your favourite tsx / bun / jest / vitest / ... to run stuff>"
    "clean": "tspc --build --clean",
    "build": "tspc --build --force",
    "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production node --enable-source-maps server.js"
},
"dependencies": {
  "restfuncs-server": "^3.0.0",
  "restfuncs-client": "^2.0.0"
},
"devDependencies": {
  "typescript": "=5.1.x",
  "ts-patch": "^3.0.2",
  "restfuncs-transformer": "^1.0.0",
  "cross-env": "^7.0.3"
},
````
The `build` script compiles for production with `tspc` (instead of `tsc`) from the [ts-patch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-patch) package, which allows for our 3 transformer plugins in `tsconfig.json` (No worries: Despite the name "ts-patch", it runs in "live mode" so nothing will be patched here).
See, [how the transformer chain works](https://github.com/bogeeee/restfuncs/tree/3.x/transformer/readme.md#how-the-transformer-chain-works).

The `dev` script sets `NODE_ENV=development` to tell Restfuncs that it can ignore all security validations and therefore there's no need for all that transformer chain.
So you're fast and unrestricted during developmentüëç. But be warned: You should still **check very often, that the production run (`build` + `start`) is still working !!!** Otherwise, things can break unnoticed, i.e., if you import ".ts" instead of ".js", if there are some tsc-only compile errors, or if the bundler's build tries to follow into server-side symbols. Especially for the last one, it can be hard to track down the reason, if you face a lot of code changes at once. So check often !!!  

_Congrats, you've got the concept!  
Now use your IDE's intellisense and have a quick browse through the `/* XxxOptions */`. That JSDoc is considered the official documentation and it won't be repeated here.
In some cases where more configuration needs to be decided for, contextual error messages will guide you. So don't be scared of them and read them and see them as part of the concept._

# Example projects

- [Hello world web app](https://github.com/bogeeee/restfuncs/tree/3.x/examples/express-and-vite) (use as starter stack) [![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/bogeeee/restfuncs/tree/3.x/examples/express-and-vite?title=Restfuncs%20hello%20world%20example&file=client%2Findex.ts,GreeterSession.ts) 
- [Hello world web app with server and client in separate dirs / packages](https://github.com/bogeeee/restfuncs/tree/3.x/examples/express-and-vite-separate) (if you prefer that cleaner layout)
- [Hello world Web app with authentication](https://github.com/bogeeee/restfuncs/tree/3.x/examples/express-and-vite-with-authentication) (uses things from the Advanced chapter) [![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/bogeeee/restfuncs/tree/3.x/examples/express-and-vite-with-authentication?title=Restfuncs%20-auth-%20example&file=client%2Findex.ts,MainframeSession.ts)


_They use vite, which is a very minimalistic/ (zero conf) web bundler with full support for React/JSX, Typescript, hot module reloading. Hope you'll like this as a starter stack for your webapp._

# Store values in the browser-session:
With Restfuncs, session values are stored in a typesafe way as fields in your `ServerSession` class. 

See the following example: 

````typescript
import {ServerSession} from "restfuncs-server";

export class MyServerSession extends ServerSession {

  myLogonUserId?: string // This value gets stored in the session under the key "myLogonUserId".

  @remote whoIsLoggedIn() {
    const user = getUser(this.myLogonUserId); // Read a session field
  }
}
````
When you modify the fields and after successful completion of the remote method, the fields get **serialized** into the session and a http cookie is sent accordingly and also
the changes are updated to all your (web-)socket connections :). 
Concurrency behaviour with (web-)socket connections is exactly like with http calls: There won't be a swapping of session values (from another call) right in the middle of a call but before the next call. _An exception is: `ServerSessionOptions#inMemorySessions`._

Note, that Restfuncs will enforce some rules:
- The **initial field values must be deterministic** to allow for lazy sessions. I.e. no random initial values are allowed are allowed like a field reading `myBasketId=Math.Random()` 
- If you define a field with the same name in **multiple ServerSession** classes, the **type must be compatible** cause there's only one session-cookie for all (Restfuncs will also check that at startup).
 

## File uploads

**COMING SOON!**, but the docs are already here ;)

There's no big extra way you have to go for file uploads. You just pass a browsers [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) object anywhere in your remote
method's parameters to the server. On the server side, you can then grab that and just suck on the stream and restfuncs will automatically send that file in an extra http request in the background/automatically.
There's just one thing. Because the browser API's [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) class is not type compatible with the server API, you have to cast it to the `UploadFile` type. See example/client.ts. 
Example:

````typescript
import {ServerSession, ServerSessionOptions, UploadFile, remote} from "restfuncs-server";

export class MyServerSession extends ServerSession {

  /**
   * @param someotherField
   * @param myUploadFile You can pass UploadFile objects anywhere/deeply and also as ...rest arguments. As soon as you read from the the stream, the restfuncs client will send that file in an extra http request in the background/automatically.
   */
  @remote myRemoteMethodWithUploadFile(someotherField: string, myUploadFile: UploadFile) {
    // TODO
    return "Your file was uploaded"
  }
}
````

**client.ts**
````typescript
import {UploadFile} from "restfuncs-common";
import {RestfuncsClient} from "restfuncs-client";
import {MyServerSession} from "../path/to/server/code/or/its/packagename/MyServerSession.js" // Gives us the full end2end type support

const myRemoteSession = new RestfuncsClient<MyServerSession>("/myAPI", {/* RestfuncsClientOptions */}).proxy; // Create a client, as usual
const myBrowserFile = document.querySelector("#myFileInput").files[0]; // Retrieve your File object(s) from an <input type="file" /> (here), or from a DragEvent.dataTransfer.files
await myRemoteSession.myRemoteMethodWithUploadFile("someContext", myBrowserFile as UploadFile) // And send myBrowserFile to the server. Note: You must cast myBrowserFile to the `UploadFile` type.
````


You can also call `myRemoteMethodWithUploadFile` via [REST interface](#rest-interface)

# Server events via callback functions
**Tl;dr:** Have you tried, sending a callback function to the server? This worksüòéüòéüòé...imagine the opportunities! If you store references for longer, mind cleaning them up on client disconnect. The `ClientCallbackSet` and `ClientCallbackSetPerItem` util classes will help you with that. All args + results are safely type checked at runtime üõ°üõ°üõ°.  

Now to the content:

You want your client to react to a certain event that happens on the server ? Restfuncs solves this very elegantly: You can have functions in the remote method parameters. Even nested. Just think of callback functions in your daily javascript life _(but not about callback-hell from the old days before async/await/Promise was introduced üòÜüòÜüòÜ)_.
You call them on the server (any time and as often as you want) and they get executed on the client ;) _All via (web-)socket push events of course_. Example:

````typescript
// On the server:
@remote notifyMeWhenSomeoneEntersTheChatroom(chatroom: string, onUserEntersChat (user: User) => void) {
    // ...later, somewhere in your code:
    onUserEntersChat(someUser) // Call the callback
}

// on the client:
myRemoteSession.notifyMeWhenSomeoneEntersTheChatroom("#restfuncs_is_great", (user) => { console.log(`${user.name} entered the chatroom`) })
````

Callbacks can also return some result (via Promise) and the server can await it.
The callack's arguments and the result are validated at runtime, just like with a normal remote method. Except the [automatic trimming](#trim-off-extra-properties) is not enabled by default.
In the `RemoteMethodOptions` you'll find some options for changing the default behaviour.


### Worry free instance remembering
_It's propably not worth mentioning, but: Same function instances on the client result in same function instances on the server. The server remembers them. 
This allows for worry free use of `addEventListener(somefunction)` + `removeEventListener(somefunction)` style code_ 

### Trim off extra properties
This is not done by default. If you want to trim off extra properties, similar to `RemoteMethodOptions#trimArguments`, you have to use the `withTrim` function:

````typescript
import {withTrim} from "restfuncs-server";
// ...later, somewhere in your code:
withTrim(onUserEntersChat)(someUser) // Call the callback
````
for more info, see the JSDoc of `withTrim`.

### Limitations
Callbacks can only be declared 'inline' in the line of your remote method's declaration. Like: `@remote myRemoteMethod(...the arrow(s) => must be somewhere inside here...)`. Deeply nested in some (inline) object structure is also fine. But not in an external type and then **refer** to it. _This is for the restfuncs-transformer to be able to scan them and generate the security validation code. At that transformation stage, it only sees the syntax tree and can't follow into types_. 

### Prevent resource exhaustion on the server
In the world wide web. Clients may not always be so friendly to call removeEventListener but instead just disconnect. To help you, clean those up to now grow your precious memory,
you can either listen for disconnect events via:

````typescript
import {ClientCallback} from "restfuncs-server";

(myCallbackFn as ClientCallback).socketConnection.onClose(() => {
    // <- unregister myCallbackFn here
})
````

...or use the utility classes `ClientCallbackSet` and `ClientCallbackSetPerItem` _(import {...} from "restfuncs-server")_. You can add listeners to them and they get removed automatically on disconnect. See JSDoc there. 

### Advanced: Resource cleanup on the client
Just in case you have a very heavy and rich client, you may at some point wonder, how and when the references to the callback functions are cleaned up:

- Garbage collection of your (callback-) function on the server is automatically reported to the client.
- If that is too late or too unpredictable for you, you can use `free(myCallbackFn)` (`import {free} from "restfuncs-server"`) to tell the client, that the function is not held anymore.


# Advanced

## Access the raw request/response/websocket fields

There's a virtual runtime field named `call` where you can access your runtime context. Use intellisense for docs. Example:

````typescript
@remote myRemoteMethod() {
  const req = this.call.req; // Express's req object
  const res = this.call.res; // Express's res object 
  const conn = this.call.socketConnection; // Restfuncs's connection. Wraps the engine.io socket.
  
  res!.header("Content-Type", "text/plain")
  
  return `your ip address is: ${req!.ip}`
}
````


## Intercept calls
### On the server
It's possible to intercept each call to i.e. check for auth (see example project) or handle errors.
In your ServerSession class, **override the `doCall` method** Use your IDE's intellisense (ctrl+space) to override it. It would look like this:

````typescript
export class MyServerSession extends ServerSession {
  
  protected async doCall(funcName: string, args: any[]) {
    try {
      // ... Intercept before
      const result = await super.doCall(funcName, args);
      // ... Intercept after
      return result;
    } catch (e) { // Intercept on error (if really needed). Also see the #error-handling chapter
      throw e; // When doing so, it is adviced to throw an error again. Restfuncs will do the proper reporting to the client.  
    } finally {
      //... Intercept finally
    }
  }
}
````

### On the client

Same same like [on the server](#on-the-server): You override the `RestfuncsClient#doCall` method. To get to the goal, you must subclass the RestfuncsClient. Example:

````typescript
//Create your own subclass of RestfuncsClient...
class MyRestfuncsClient<S> extends RestfuncsClient<S> {
    
  async doCall(funcName: string, args: any[]) {
    try {
      // ... Intercept before
      let result = await super.doCall(funcName, args);

### Working example

[Hello world Web app with authentication](https://github.com/bogeeee/restfuncs/tree/3.x/examples/express-and-vite-with-authentication) [![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/bogeeee/restfuncs/tree/3.x/examples/express-and-vite-with-authentication?title=Restfuncs%20-auth-%20example&file=client%2Findex.ts,MainframeSession.ts)

This example intercepts calls on the server and on the client.

## Html / images / binary as a result

To serve a non API result, the remote method must explicitly **set the content type**. Return the result via `string`, `Buffer` or `Readable`. Example:
```typescript
    @remote({isSafe: true /* Lessen restrictions and allow this method to be called by GET ... */}) 
    getAvatarImage(name: string) {
        // ... therefore (SECURITY) code in `isSafe` methods must perform read operations only !
        this.call.res!.contentType("image/x-png")
        return fs.createReadStream("/someImage.png") // Returns a Readable which is streamed to client. You can also return Buffer, String, File(TODO)
    }
```

**‚ö†‚ö†‚ö† Security note:** When serving html with rich content or with scripts, you might want to add the [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) middleware in front of your ServerSession for additional protection via `app.use("/myAPI", helmet(), MyServerSession.createExpressHandler())`

## REST interface
<details>
  <summary>‚ö†‚ö†‚ö† Security must-read </summary>

For handcrafted calls from inside a **browser**, **you** (the clients) need to care about [protecting **your** session from CSRF attacks from other browser windows](#csrf-protection).
</details>

**Tl;dr:** Just form the http call from your imagination, and its likely a way that works, or Restfuncs will tell you exactly, what's wrong with the params.

Now to the content:  
Like the name Restfuncs suggests, there's also a REST/http interface for the case that you don't use the neat RestfuncsClient, or you want to call these from non-js languages, etc.  
Restfuncs follows a **zero conf / gracefully accepting / non-strict** approach (a client is still free to implement strictness to the REST paradigm):  
The following example remote method...
```typescript
    async getBook(name: string, authorFilter?: string) {
        
    }
```
...can be called in almost **every imaginable way** through http like:

| Method | Url | Body | Description 
| :----: | :-----------------------: | :-------------: | :-----------: |
| GET | _/**getBook**/1984/George%20Orwell_ | | **List** arguments in the **path**
| GET | _/**getBook**?1984,George%20Orwell_ | | **List** arguments in the **query**
| GET | _/**getBook**?name=1984&authorFilter=George%20Orwell_ | | **Name** arguments in the **query**
| GET | _/**getBook**?__&lt;custom implementation&gt;_ | | Override the `parseQuery` method in your ServerSession subclass. See JSDoc.  [Here's a discussion about different url serializers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15872658/standardized-way-to-serialize-json-to-query-string) 
| GET | _/**book** ..._ | | Read **"GET book"** like `getBook`. Applies to other http verbs also. Additionally **"PUT book"** will try to call `updateBook` or `setBook` cause this sounds more common in programming languages.
| POST | _/**getBook**_ | `{"name": "1984", "authorFilter":"George Orwell"}` | **Name** arguments inside JSON body
| POST | _/**getBook**_ | `["1984", "George Orwell"]` | **List** arguments inside JSON body
| POST | _/**getBook**/1984_ | `"George Orwell"` | **Single** JSON primitive
| POST | _/**getBook**/1984_ | `George Orwell` | **Plain string**. For this you must explicitly set the `Content-Type` header to `text/plain`
| POST | _/**getBook**_ | `name=1984&authorFilter=George%20Orwell` | Classic **Html &lt;form&gt;** with `Content-Type` = `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. Still remember these ? They can be used here as well ;)
| POST | _/**getBook**/1984_ | _&lt;Any binary data&gt;_ | **Binary Data**. Your function parameter (i.e. here the 2nd one) must be of type `Buffer`.

You are free to mix these styles ;) The styles are parsed in the order as listed, so arguments from a lower line in the table will -override _named_- or -append to _listed_- ones from above.

Also it's possible to have Readable and Buffers as parameters ...
```typescript
    async uploadAvatarImage(userName: string, image: Readable) {
        
    }
```
...can be called through http like:

| Method | Url | Body | Description
| :----: | :-----------------------: | :-------------: | :-----------: |
| POST | _/**uploadAvatarImage**/Donald%20Duck_ | &lt;<binary image data>&gt; | Binary data directly in the body (TODO)


### Content types
To specify what you **send** and how it should be interpreted, [set the `Content-Type` header](#access-the-raw-requestresponsewebsocket-fields) to 
 - `application/json` _(**default**)_ - Mind that JSON lacks support for some Data types.
 - [`application/brillout-json`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brillout/json-serializer) - Better. Fixes the above.
 - `text/plain` - For the one case, see table above.
 - `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` - For classic html `<form method="post">`.
 - _Any other_ - Can be consumed by `Readable` or `Buffer` parameter

### Auto value conversion
Parameter values will be **reasonably** auto converted to the actual declared type.
- The **query or path** can only carry strings, so they **will auto convert to boolean, number, Date, BigInt** types.
- **JSON**'s unsupported `undefined` (in arrays), `BigInt` and `Date` values will auto convert.   
  _Note that it currently doesn't support nested properties like `myFunc(i: {someDate: Date})`. Set and Map are also not supported. Have a look at the source of `ServerSession.autoConvertValueForParameter_fromJson` method to improve it._

_Restfuncs won't try to convert to ambiguous types like `string|bool` cause that would be too much magic and could cause unwanted behaviour flipping in your app (i.e., someone evil enters 'true' as username and this makes its way to a query param)._

_Note for the security cautious of you: After all this "wild" parameter collection and auto conversion, the actual call-ready parameters will be security-checked again in a [second stage](#runtime-arguments-typechecking-shielding-against-evil-input)._

### Receiving content (json-like result)
To specify what you want to **receive** in the response, Set the `Accept` header to
 - `application/json` _(**default**)_ - Mind that JSON lacks support for some Data types.
 - [`application/brillout-json`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brillout/json-serializer) - Better.


## Using websockets
**Tl;dr:** The RestfuncsClient already uses Websockets by default. There's usually nothing to configure.  

It is required that you use the `restfuncsExpress()` instead of `express()` server, like shown in the [getting started chapter/server.ts](#getting-started).
Make sure, the path `/engine.io_restfuncs` is reachable and not blocked by your proxy. See `ServerOptions#engineIoOptions.path`. 
Also see the `RestfuncsClientOptions#useSocket` and `RestfuncsClientOptions#shareSocketConnections` options.

## Error handling
**Tl;dr:** usually no need to implement it, because Restfuncs already brings a comprehensive reporting to the client.

Besides that, there are options to tweak: See `ServerSessionOptions#logErrors` and `ServerSessionOptions#exposeErrors`.

## Errors with http status code or special errors
If, for some specific occurrence, you need to specify the http status code or have the error always (in production) be sent to the client or have custom error properties which should (always) be sent to the client, then
throw a `new CommunicationError(...message..., {httpStatusCode: ...})` or a custom subclass of it. Here's the import: `import {CommunicationError} from "restfuncs-server"`

# Security

## CSRF protection

**Tl;dr:** **In a normal situation** (= no basic auth, no client-certs and using the RestfuncsClient), **Restfuncs already has a strong CSRF protection by default** (`corsReadToken`, enforced by the RestfuncsClient). For other situations, read the following:

Restfuncs has the following 3 protection levels (weakest to hardest) to protect against CSRF attacks. See list below.
You can enforce it by the `ServerSessionOptions#csrfProtectionMode` setting.  
**By default/ undefined, the client can decide the protection mode**. _"wait a minute, how can this be secure ?" See explanation_. This way, all sorts of clients can be served. Think of non-browser clients where CSRF does not have relevance, so their devs are not bugged with implementing token fetches.  
_Explanation: The clients indicate, which csrfProtection mode they want to "play" in a header proactively on every request. Restfuncs will raise an error, if another browser client (or i.e an attacker from another browser tab) wants to play a different mode, at the moment it tries to access the (same) session. Meaning, once the (cookie-) session is created,  the protection mode is stored in there. Note: "proactively" means: no header = defaulting to `preflight` is still allowed, as long as it's consistent._

The above policy (let the clients decide) only covers sessions. So <strong>when using client-certificates or basic auth, you must explicitly decide for a setting</strong>, and you should use at least set it to `corsReadToken` when dealing with browser clients.

Here are the modes. `ServerSessionOptions#csrfProtectionMode` / `RestfuncsClient#csrfProtectionMode` can be set to:

* `preflight` (**default**): Relies on the browser to make a CORS-preflight before doing the actual request and bail if that preflight failed.
  The [~1.5% browsers which don't implement CORS](https://caniuse.com/cors) are blacklisted. This also works with all non-browser clients and they don't need to implement any measurements.
  [Simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests) are denied, unless they are [@safe](#simple-requests-and-safe).  
  A lot of the web out there relies on CORS-preflights, **but this method has at least a problem within the [specification](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-requests)**:
  ````  
  A CORS-preflight request is a CORS request that checks to see if the CORS protocol is understood.
  ````
  It doesn't state that a browser has to stop the request after a negative preflight. The following actual request will again contain the info whether it's allowed to read the result and browsers could legally use this as point to bail. But at that point it's already too late: The request has been executed and makes a CSRF attacker happy.
* `corsReadToken` (**used by restfuncs-client**) This is a safer mode which works around this unclear in-spec/in-practice situation. The client must (if not already clear by `Origin` or `Referrer` headers) prove to have made a successful read, before the call is allowed to execute.  
  In detail (if you want to implement it yourself):
  - The Client calls the `getCorsReadToken()` ServerSession method to get a token string. This the *read-proof*.
  - Every further http request now includes the fields `csrfProtectionMode=corsReadToken` and `corsReadToken=<the token>` in the headers, in the query (GET only) or in the body like [usual named parameters](#rest-interface). See the `devForceTokenCheck` option for development. A http response code `480` is sent when the token was missing/incorrect.

* `csrfToken`
  Strictly checks for a token that's been delivered in the start page (by your implementation). It's checked on every call / every session access _(enforced by client / enforced by server)_. The advantage is just that it relies less on in-depth defence / reflection of browser-behaviour and is commonly considered a simple-and-effective industry standard.
  - You deliver/embed the csrfToken, which you've got from `yourServerSessionClass.getCsrfToken(session: object)` or `app.getCsrfTokens(session: object)`, inside your *main / index.html* page. This is the tricky/inconvenient part, cause you usually use some web packer.
  - When using the restfuncs client, you pass it to the options via {csrfProtectionMode:"csrfToken", csrfToken: theToken}.
  - With plain fetch requests, you include the parameter: `csrfToken=<the token>` _in the header, in the query (GET only) or in the body like a [usual named parameter](#rest-interface)_. A http response code `403` is sent when the token was missing/incorrect.



Notes:
- [More on the security concept](server/Security%20concept.md#csrf-protection)
- For, when having multiple ServerSession classes: _They share the same cookieSession, but still every ServerSession class (or security group) has its individual corsReadToken and csrfToken there (cause allowedOrigins or other security settings may be individual). For csrfTokens, you can pass all tokens as one comma separated string, and the server will just try them all out._

## Hardening security for the paranoid
- Install the cookie handler with `cookie: {sameSite: true}`. TODO: Automatically do this if all services have default / same-site allowedOrigins
- Set `ServerSessionOptions#csrfProtectionMode` to `csrfToken` and implement the csrf token handover.


# Performance
- Read JSDoc and disable `ServerOptions#socket_requireAccessProofForIndividualServerSession`

### Writes to the session fields have some overhead
It costs an additional http roundtrip + 1 websocket roundtrip + (auto.) resend of unprocessed websocket calls. This is to ensure fail-safe commits to the http cookie and to ensure security. So keep that in mind.

# Use your own cookie handler
The build-in cookie handler goes like this, as already mentioned in the set up: `const app = restfuncsExpress({/* ServerOptions */}) // Drop in replacement for express (enhances the original).`
Alternatively (not recommended), you can still set up your own cookie handler, after using the classic express: `app = express()`, or by setting `ServerOptions#installSessionHandler` to `false`. Restfuncs will still synchronize the content to/from (Web-) Socket connections.


# Multi server environment
When using a load balancer in front of your servers, you have to configure it for [sticky sessions](https://socket.io/docs/v4/using-multiple-nodes/#enabling-sticky-session), because the underlying engine.io uses http long polling as a first, failsafe approach. You might try to also change that.  

# Tips & tricks
### Using typescript to automatically trim the output into the desired form
By default, restfuncs trims off all extra properties in the result of your remote methods to match the exact declared typescript type. 
You can make use of this in combination with these two handy typescript utility types: [Pick<Type, Keys>](using Pick and Omit) and [Omit<Type, Keys>](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#omittype-keys) 
Example:
````typescript
type IUser=  {
  name: string,
  age: number,
  password: string,
}

@remote returnsPublicUser(): Pick<IUser, "name" | "age"> { // This will return the user without password
    const user = {name: "Franz", age: 45, password: "geheim!"} // got it from the db somewhere
    return user;
}

@remote returnsPublicUser(): Omit<IUser, "password">{  // Also this will return the user without password
   ...
}
````
or you could also create a new type and go with `returnsSafeUser(): SanitizedUser {...}`. Etc. etc. you've got all the world of typescript here ;)

### Validate stuff on the inside
Now that you've gone all the long way of setting up the build, you have [Typia](https://typia.io) at hand and can use it to validate your objects, i.e. before they get stored the db.
Example:
````typescript
import typia, { tags } from "typia"

type User = {
  name: string & tags.MaxLength<255>
}

if(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') { // cause in dev, you usually run without transformed code
  typia.assertEquals<User>(myUser) // Validate myUser before storing it in the db
}
db.store(myUser)
````
[Also you can inspect all your types at runtime](https://typescript-rtti.org/) 

# Migration from 2.x
As [the 2.x release was announced to be non production-ready](https://github.com/bogeeee/restfuncs/tree/2.x?tab=readme-ov-file#--warning-not-yet-secure-for-production--),
here is how to migrate to the production-ready 3.x version, [where those issues were fixed](server/Security%20concept.md#validation-library)
- Look at how the [Build setup](#setting-up-the-build-here-it-gets-a-bit-nasty-) has changed
- Disabling security is now influenced by the NODE_ENV==development setting. ServerSessionOptions#devDisableSecurity falls back to this env variable now.

# That's it !
